### App Idea: Fridge Tracker

**App Description:**
I want to build an app that tracks the items in my fridge. The app will allow users to input the date the items were purchased, when they were opened, and their expiration date. Users will be able to view a list of fridge items sorted by expiration date, with the soonest expiring items displayed at the top. This will help users minimize food waste by reminding them to use items before they expire.
